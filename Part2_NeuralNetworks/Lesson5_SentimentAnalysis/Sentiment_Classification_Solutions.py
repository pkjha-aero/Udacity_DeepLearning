# **Note:** The data in `reviews.txt` we're using has already been preprocessed a bit and contains only lower case characters. If we were working from raw data, where we didn't know it was all lower case, we would want to add a step here to convert it. That's so we treat different variations of the same word, like `The`, `the`, and `THE`, all the same way.

# # Project 1: Quick Theory Validation<a id='project_1'></a>
# 
# There are multiple ways to implement these projects, but in order to get your code closer to what Andrew shows in his solutions, we've provided some hints and starter code throughout this notebook.
# 
# You'll find the [Counter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) class to be useful in this exercise, as well as the [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) library.

# In[ ]:


from collections import Counter
import numpy as np


# We'll create three `Counter` objects, one for words from postive reviews, one for words from negative reviews, and one for all the words.

# In[ ]:


# Create three Counter objects to store positive, negative and total counts
positive_counts = Counter()
negative_counts = Counter()
total_counts = Counter()


# **TODO:** Examine all the reviews. For each word in a positive review, increase the count for that word in both your positive counter and the total words counter; likewise, for each word in a negative review, increase the count for that word in both your negative counter and the total words counter.
# 
# **Note:** Throughout these projects, you should use `split(' ')` to divide a piece of text (such as a review) into individual words. If you use `split()` instead, you'll get slightly different results than what the videos and solutions show.

# In[ ]:


# Loop over all the words in all the reviews and increment the counts in the appropriate counter objects
for i in range(len(reviews)):
    if(labels[i] == 'POSITIVE'):
        for word in reviews[i].split(" "):
            positive_counts[word] += 1
            total_counts[word] += 1
    else:
        for word in reviews[i].split(" "):
            negative_counts[word] += 1
            total_counts[word] += 1


# Run the following two cells to list the words used in positive reviews and negative reviews, respectively, ordered from most to least commonly used. 

# In[ ]:


# Examine the counts of the most common words in positive reviews
positive_counts.most_common()


# In[ ]:


# Examine the counts of the most common words in negative reviews
negative_counts.most_common()


# As you can see, common words like "the" appear very often in both positive and negative reviews. Instead of finding the most common words in positive or negative reviews, what you really want are the words found in positive reviews more often than in negative reviews, and vice versa. To accomplish this, you'll need to calculate the **ratios** of word usage between positive and negative reviews.
# 
# **TODO:** Check all the words you've seen and calculate the ratio of postive to negative uses and store that ratio in `pos_neg_ratios`. 
# >Hint: the positive-to-negative ratio for a given word can be calculated with `positive_counts[word] / float(negative_counts[word]+1)`. Notice the `+1` in the denominator – that ensures we don't divide by zero for words that are only seen in positive reviews.

# In[ ]:


pos_neg_ratios = Counter()

# Calculate the ratios of positive and negative uses of the most common words
# Consider words to be "common" if they've been used at least 100 times
for term,cnt in list(total_counts.most_common()):
    if(cnt > 100):
        pos_neg_ratio = positive_counts[term] / float(negative_counts[term]+1)
        pos_neg_ratios[term] = pos_neg_ratio


# Examine the ratios you've calculated for a few words:

# In[ ]:


print("Pos-to-neg ratio for 'the' = {}".format(pos_neg_ratios["the"]))
print("Pos-to-neg ratio for 'amazing' = {}".format(pos_neg_ratios["amazing"]))
print("Pos-to-neg ratio for 'terrible' = {}".format(pos_neg_ratios["terrible"]))


# Looking closely at the values you just calculated, we see the following: 
# 
# * Words that you would expect to see more often in positive reviews – like "amazing" – have a ratio greater than 1. The more skewed a word is toward postive, the farther from 1 its positive-to-negative ratio  will be.
# * Words that you would expect to see more often in negative reviews – like "terrible" – have positive values that are less than 1. The more skewed a word is toward negative, the closer to zero its positive-to-negative ratio will be.
# * Neutral words, which don't really convey any sentiment because you would expect to see them in all sorts of reviews – like "the" – have values very close to 1. A perfectly neutral word – one that was used in exactly the same number of positive reviews as negative reviews – would be almost exactly 1. The `+1` we suggested you add to the denominator slightly biases words toward negative, but it won't matter because it will be a tiny bias and later we'll be ignoring words that are too close to neutral anyway.
# 
# Ok, the ratios tell us which words are used more often in postive or negative reviews, but the specific values we've calculated are a bit difficult to work with. A very positive word like "amazing" has a value above 4, whereas a very negative word like "terrible" has a value around 0.18. Those values aren't easy to compare for a couple of reasons:
# 
# * Right now, 1 is considered neutral, but the absolute value of the postive-to-negative rations of very postive words is larger than the absolute value of the ratios for the very negative words. So there is no way to directly compare two numbers and see if one word conveys the same magnitude of positive sentiment as another word conveys negative sentiment. So we should center all the values around netural so the absolute value fro neutral of the postive-to-negative ratio for a word would indicate how much sentiment (positive or negative) that word conveys.
# * When comparing absolute values it's easier to do that around zero than one. 
# 
# To fix these issues, we'll convert all of our ratios to new values using logarithms.
# 
# **TODO:** Go through all the ratios you calculated and convert them to logarithms. (i.e. use `np.log(ratio)`)
# 
# In the end, extremely positive and extremely negative words will have positive-to-negative ratios with similar magnitudes but opposite signs.

# In[ ]:


# Convert ratios to logs
for word,ratio in pos_neg_ratios.most_common():
    pos_neg_ratios[word] = np.log(ratio)


# **NOTE:** In the video, Andrew uses the following formulas for the previous cell:
# > * For any postive words, convert the ratio using `np.log(ratio)`
# > * For any negative words, convert the ratio using `-np.log(1/(ratio + 0.01))`
# 
# These won't give you the exact same results as the simpler code we show in this notebook, but the values will be similar. In case that second equation looks strange, here's what it's doing: First, it divides one by a very small number, which will produce a larger positive number. Then, it takes the `log` of that, which produces numbers similar to the ones for the postive words. Finally, it negates the values by adding that minus sign up front. The results are extremely positive and extremely negative words having positive-to-negative ratios with similar magnitudes but oppositite signs, just like when we use `np.log(ratio)`.

# Examine the new ratios you've calculated for the same words from before:

# In[ ]:


print("Pos-to-neg ratio for 'the' = {}".format(pos_neg_ratios["the"]))
print("Pos-to-neg ratio for 'amazing' = {}".format(pos_neg_ratios["amazing"]))
print("Pos-to-neg ratio for 'terrible' = {}".format(pos_neg_ratios["terrible"]))


# If everything worked, now you should see neutral words with values close to zero. In this case, "the" is near zero but slightly positive, so it was probably used in more positive reviews than negative reviews. But look at "amazing"'s ratio - it's above `1`, showing it is clearly a word with positive sentiment. And "terrible" has a similar score, but in the opposite direction, so it's below `-1`. It's now clear that both of these words are associated with specific, opposing sentiments.
# 
# Now run the following cells to see more ratios. 
# 
# The first cell displays all the words, ordered by how associated they are with postive reviews. (Your notebook will most likely truncate the output so you won't actually see *all* the words in the list.)
# 
# The second cell displays the 30 words most associated with negative reviews by reversing the order of the first list and then looking at the first 30 words. (If you want the second cell to display all the words, ordered by how associated they are with negative reviews, you could just write `reversed(pos_neg_ratios.most_common())`.)
# 
# You should continue to see values similar to the earlier ones we checked – neutral words will be close to `0`, words will get more positive as their ratios approach and go above `1`, and words will get more negative as their ratios approach and go below `-1`. That's why we decided to use the logs instead of the raw ratios.

# In[ ]:


# words most frequently seen in a review with a "POSITIVE" label
pos_neg_ratios.most_common()


# In[ ]:


# words most frequently seen in a review with a "NEGATIVE" label
list(reversed(pos_neg_ratios.most_common()))[0:30]

# Note: Above is the code Andrew uses in his solution video, 
#       so we've included it here to avoid confusion.
#       If you explore the documentation for the Counter class, 
#       you will see you could also find the 30 least common
#       words like this: pos_neg_ratios.most_common()[:-31:-1]

# # Project 3: Building a Neural Network<a id='project_3'></a>

# **TODO:** We've included the framework of a class called `SentimentNetork`. Implement all of the items marked `TODO` in the code. These include doing the following:
# - Create a basic neural network much like the networks you've seen in earlier lessons and in Project 1, with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. 
# - Do **not** add a non-linearity in the hidden layer. That is, do not use an activation function when calculating the hidden layer outputs.
# - Re-use the code from earlier in this notebook to create the training data (see `TODO`s in the code)
# - Implement the `pre_process_data` function to create the vocabulary for our training data generating functions
# - Ensure `train` trains over the entire corpus

# # Project 5: Making our Network More Efficient<a id='project_5'></a>
# **TODO:** Make the `SentimentNetwork` class more efficient by eliminating unnecessary multiplications and additions that occur during forward and backward propagation. To do that, you can do the following:
# * Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.
# * Remove the `update_input_layer` function - you will not need it in this version.
# * Modify `init_network`:
# >* You no longer need a separate input layer, so remove any mention of `self.layer_0`
# >* You will be dealing with the old hidden layer more directly, so create `self.layer_1`, a two-dimensional matrix with shape 1 x hidden_nodes, with all values initialized to zero
# * Modify `train`:
# >* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`. This will help with the next step.
# >* At the beginning of the function, you'll want to preprocess your reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review. This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1. Your code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.
# >* Remove call to `update_input_layer`
# >* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.
# >* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.
# >* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.
# * Modify `run`:
# >* Remove call to `update_input_layer` 
# >* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.
# >* Much like you did in `train`, you will need to pre-process the `review` so you can work with word indices, then update `layer_1` by adding weights for the indices used in the review.

# # Project 6: Reducing Noise by Strategically Reducing the Vocabulary<a id='project_6'></a>
# 
# **TODO:** Improve `SentimentNetwork`'s performance by reducing more noise in the vocabulary. Specifically, do the following:
# * Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.
# * Modify `pre_process_data`:
# >* Add two additional parameters: `min_count` and `polarity_cutoff`
# >* Calculate the positive-to-negative ratios of words used in the reviews. (You can use code you've written elsewhere in the notebook, but we are moving it into the class like we did with other helper code earlier.)
# >* Andrew's solution only calculates a postive-to-negative ratio for words that occur at least 50 times. This keeps the network from attributing too much sentiment to rarer words. You can choose to add this to your solution if you would like.  
# >* Change so words are only added to the vocabulary if they occur in the vocabulary more than `min_count` times.
# >* Change so words are only added to the vocabulary if the absolute value of their postive-to-negative ratio is at least `polarity_cutoff`
# * Modify `__init__`:
# >* Add the same two parameters (`min_count` and `polarity_cutoff`) and use them when you call `pre_process_data`
